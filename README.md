# Magisk Bixby Button Mapper
Remap the Bixby button on the Galaxy S10e from Bixby to the more common Camera button without needing Bixby service running or even installed like most other solutions.

This module requires [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk).

**WARNING:** This has only been tested on a Galaxy S10e on Android 12. There's a decent chance it'll mess something up for any other model of phone or OS version since it fully replaces the entire keymap file.

# Installation
Simply download the latest release .zip file from the GitHub Releases and install it through the Magisk Manager.

# How it works
This works by remapping key `703` from the default `WINK` to the more common `CAMERA` button. This button can then be remapped again to any button you desire including different actions for single, double and long-press in any standard button mapper appplication such as [Button Mapper](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=flar2.homebutton).
